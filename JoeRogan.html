                        US.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p> <strong>1988</strong> - Rogan's friends from gym and Taekwondo school, who he would make laugh
                        with impressions and jokes, convinced him to have a go at stand-up comedy. At 21, after six
                        months preparing material and practicing his delivery, he performed his first stand-up routine
                        on August 27, 1988, at an open-mic night at a Stitches comedy club in Boston.</p>
                </li>

                        teaching martial arts at Boston University and in Revere, Massachusetts, delivering newspapers,
                        driving a limousine, doing construction work, and completing duties for a private investigator.
                        Meanwhile, his blue comedy style earned him gigs at bachelor parties and strip clubs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> <strong>1990</strong> - Rogan moved to New York City. As a full-time comedian, he was
                        "scratching and grinding" for money, and stayed with his grandfather in Newark for the first six
                        months.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> <strong>1994</strong> - Rogan relocated to Los Angeles where his first national television spot
                        followed on the MTV comedy show Half-Hour Comedy Hour. The appearance led to the network
                        offering him a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a "dopey game
                        show" for $500. Rogan declined, but it prompted Sussman to send tapes of Rogan's performances to
                        several networks, which sparked a bidding war. After a period of negotiation, Rogan accepted a
                        development deal with the Disney network. He secured his first major acting role in the 1994
                        nine-episode Fox sitcom Hardball as Frank Valente, a young, ego-centric star player on a
                        professional baseball team.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> <strong>1997</strong> - Rogan began working for the mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate
                        Fighting Championship as a backstage and post-fight interviewer.</p>

                        Dana White, White was able to hire Rogan for free in exchange for prime event tickets for him
                        and his friends. After about fifteen free gigs as a commentator, Rogan accepted pay for the job,
                        working alongside Mike Goldberg.</p>

                        NBC to host the American edition of Fear Factor. He declined initially as he thought the network
                        would not air such a program due to its content, but Sussman convinced him to accept. Rogan
                        later said that the main reason he accepted was to obtain observations and anecdotes for his
                        stand-up comedy. The show increased Rogan's national exposure which caused turnouts at his
                        stand-up gigs to grow.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
